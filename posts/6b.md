For my AT2 response, I have chosen to engage with Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation by Laboria Cuboniks. This manifesto's call for a technomaterialist, anti-naturalist, and gender-abolitionist feminism resonates deeply with my creative and political sensibilities.​


#Selected Passages
“If nature is unjust, change nature.”
This imperative challenges the notion of nature as a fixed, moral authority, advocating for the use of technology to reshape societal norms and structures.

# Techniques Employed

Glitch: Utilizing visual disruptions to symbolize the breakdown of traditional gender binaries and the instability of 'natural' categories.​

# Creative Concept

This interactive p5.js sketch captures the user’s webcam feed and applies pixel-sorting glitch effects based on their movement. The more motion the camera detects, the more visually and sonically chaotic the output becomes — reinforcing the idea that stillness maintains legibility, but movement destabilizes form.

*Visual Glitching*

Based on motion difference across frames

The sketch distorts RGB channels and applies randomized pixel fill

You become unreadable — a critique of facial recognition, legibility, and enforced normativity

*Sonic Chaos*

White noise, sawtooth oscillation, and tremor modulated via envelope and mapped to motion speed

The faster you move, the louder and more dissonant the sound

It reflects XF’s call to “use technology against itself” — the noise of resistance

# Xenofeminist Alignment

*Anti-naturalism* → The camera is not a mirror; it's a site of distortion

*Alienation-as-tool* → Glitches estrange the familiar, generating new identities from broken signals

*Technomaterialism* → The medium (camera/screen/audio) is the message: a reactive system where code is feminist strategy
