To design sonic chaos for my AT2, I’ve used motion speed from webcam input to drive a noisy, layered audio field with fluctuating intensity. Every 24 seconds, a sinusoidal envelope pulls the soundscape from calm to chaos and back — reflecting effective complexity in time.

According to the theory of effective complexity, chaos thrives when there's tension between order and disorder. In sound, this happens through structures like:

- Rhythm (predictable) vs glitch (random)
- Voice (legible) vs noise (texture)
- Silence vs saturation
- 
In Natalie Loveless’s “From Relational to Ecological Form,” defamiliarization is key: art must estrange us from what we assume is natural. This sketch does so sonically — you move, and the system responds with glitched sound forms. You're not in control, only in relation.
