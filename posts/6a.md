# What is each library for?
*q5.js*

A creative coding library similar to p5.js but designed to be modular and signal-based. It allows you to create audio-visual sketches with control over envelopes, oscillators, and reactive systems.

*c2.js*

A reactive coding library for creating signal flow graphs and generative media systems. It’s great for composing behaviors over time with composable units (signals, envelopes, etc.), often in creative code or generative design projects.

*svg.js*

A lightweight JavaScript library to manipulate and animate SVGs in the browser. It provides a simple API to draw, transform, and animate vector shapes directly in HTML.

# Text Summaries

*Information & Thinking — Michel Serres*

Serres explores how information is no longer passive. In the digital age, data flows and networks change how we think. He argues that knowledge is shaped less by linear reasoning and more by interconnected, chaotic systems — a postmodern view of logic and learning shaped by digital tools and noise.

*What Is It Like to Be A Fungus? — Merlin Sheldrake*

Sheldrake challenges anthropocentric views of intelligence and experience. Fungi, through decentralized growth and symbiotic communication, demonstrate forms of non-human agency and thought. The essay invites us to imagine a non-binary consciousness rooted in networks, not brains — aligning with posthuman and ecological ideas.

*Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation — Laboria Cuboniks*

Xenofeminism (XF) is a techno-materialist feminist manifesto. It embraces alienation as a space for reinvention, demanding the use of technology, science, and abstraction to dismantle oppressive systems. XF is pro-hacking, pro-open-source, and anti-essentialist — seeking to liberate gender, biology, and social structures from inherited constraints.
