In her essay on Sianne Ngai’s aesthetic theory, McKenzie Wark writes that "Unlike the interesting, the zany really works against its constraints." The zany, in Ngai’s terms, is overtasked, overloaded, always doing too much. It’s chaotic not because it fails to follow rules, but because it over-performs them until they collapse.

The chaotic and the zany share a refusal of coherence. Both overwhelm structure. But while chaos may be unstructured by default, the zany emerges from too much structure — too many moving parts, inputs, gestures. Zany is the worker who sings while juggling six plates, not out of joy, but survival.

My project, Glitching the Interface, becomes zany through:

# Multitasking: The sketch responds simultaneously to video input, sound synthesis, sinusoidal modulation, and random glitches.

# Overreaction: A single twitch results in a cascade of glitch + noise — an excessive response to minimal input.

# Labor made visible: The system performs a strenuous loop every frame — scanning motion, drawing video, modulating audio — a kind of performative code labor.

It’s zany because it works too hard, and makes that work visible as a glitchy, sonic mess.

Glitching the Interface responds to Laboria Cuboniks’ Xenofeminism by using technology to actively distort representation. The webcam doesn’t reflect the user — it breaks them apart. Movement doesn’t reveal identity — it erodes it into sound and noise. XF urges us to use systems against themselves, and this sketch turns the camera, microphone, and browser into sites of alienation.

Rather than produce a stable subject, the sketch produces instability — fragmented visuals and screaming synthesis — an interface that refuses to naturalize you.
