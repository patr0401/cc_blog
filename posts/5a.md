# Blog Post: Post-Digital Practice – Rafael Rozendaal
*Artist Chosen: Rafaël Rozendaal*

*Work: Into Time (2010) — intotime.com*

*Essay Reference: Florian Cramer, What is Post-Digital?*

# Why Rozendaal is Post-Digital

In What is Post-Digital?, Florian Cramer argues that post-digital art is less about abandoning the digital and more about integrating it so fully into our lives that the distinction between digital and physical becomes irrelevant. Rozendaal exemplifies this by making browser-native art that is not about technology — but simply uses it as material, like paint or canvas.

Rozendaal’s Into Time (2010) is an abstract interactive website. When the viewer moves their mouse, colorful geometric gradients morph and slide, revealing new patterns with each movement. It’s not a painting, yet it behaves with painterly responsiveness. It is minimal, code-based, and hosted online — yet it’s intimate and meditative. It exists outside of the gallery and within the flow of everyday internet use — which is exactly the kind of de-formalized, embedded digital experience Cramer frames as "post-digital."

# Technology Used

Rozendaal's work is primarily made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — often with canvas APIs and basic vector math. The work does not rely on flashy libraries; instead, he uses minimal code to emphasize interaction, rhythm, and color.

# If Built with JavaScript: Potential APIs and Libraries

If we were to re-create Into Time using modern JavaScript tools, we could use:

*p5.js* for canvas drawing and interactivity
*GSAP* for smooth motion and timing
*dat.GUI* or *Tweakpane* for UI-based interaction experiments
*WebGL* or *three.js* for extended visual effects
And for a textual response, *RiTa.js*
