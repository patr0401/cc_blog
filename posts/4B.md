According to Rosa Menkman's “Glitch Studies Manifesto”, glitch disrupts not only form but expectation. It reveals the medium by pushing it to break — the distortion isn’t just aesthetic, it’s epistemic. Similarly, in Olia Lialina's “A Vernacular Web”, glitch is positioned as part of a folk digital vernacular: messy, broken, yet expressive.

This sits squarely within what Sianne Ngai calls the aesthetic register of the “zany”: the glitching portrait is chaotic, hyperactive, and animated. It might also flirt with the “cute” (playful, broken) or even the “interesting” (as it demands contemplation rather than pleasure).

In terms of effective complexity, the portrait balances randomness and recognizability: it’s me, but only just — complexity lies in the interplay between signal and noise.
